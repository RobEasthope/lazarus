copy: "The Lambeth Advice Network (LAN) is a network of six Lambeth based organisations that provide adivice and legal aid to the residents of the borough of Lambeth. As part of reorganisations by Lambeth Borough Council to how public services are delivered in Lambeth the Network was asked to offer a site to publicise it's services.

The design brief was for a fully responsive site highlighted the networks work and provide quick access to advice. In addition the Network needed the site to be very easy to update at a glance for their non-tech savvy staff."
