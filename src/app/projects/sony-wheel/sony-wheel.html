        <p>The Sony Wheel of FItness was the centerpiece of Haygarthâ€™s 90 day experiential tour to promote the 2015 UK launch of the Sony Xperia Z3. Completed with a very short turn around of six weeks the Wheel was sent on another two nationwide tours visiting London, Birmingham, Newcastle, and Tough Mudder events.</p>

        <p>The concept of the Sony was a simple one - walk on the wheel and after a certain speed a short promotional video would play. I did the initial technical research and planned out the user experience journey throughout the project.</p>
