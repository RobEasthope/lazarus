The Association of Lancastrians in London is a social club bringing together members from the [Duchy of Lancaster](http://www.duchyoflancaster.co.uk/) for regular meet ups and tours. The Association requested a new website and logo to both publise the organisations and to provide an easier way to communicate with it's membership.

#####The Lancastrian Crest#####
In keeping with the Associations history the new crest displays the arms of the Duchy of Lancaster: The fluer-de-lis introduced by Kind Edward III and the lion of Richard the Lionheart.
